## Network Address Table Traversal
Currenty only supports Internet Gateway Device Protocol, but I plan to add
support for Port Control Protocol and Hole-Punching. The goal, after that is
done, is to provide a single interface for NAT Traversal that will determine if
it is necessary and find which approach will work.
